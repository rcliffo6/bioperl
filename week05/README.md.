For question 4 regarding SQL, I created a proposed group of tables that would relate the messenger RNA
to its tissue type, organism it was found in, possible gene name, and information regarding the start/stop
on the chromosome of the particular organism.

There are many more tables that could be added. The mRNA is a one to many table. Gene names for the
same sequence have been changed many times. There would be a list of functions for the gene, depending
on which tissue and which organism it is found in. The organism is part of a clade, which is then part
of a clade, and one clade includes many organisms. Likewise, the tissue type has numerous cells which
perform many functions, so that one cell type would be a primary key with many cell types being part 
of the tissue. Even cell types have individual organelles, and the original mRNA sequence, probably
found in one part of the cell, could also be transported to another organelle (i.e., created in the nucleus,
transported to mitochondria).

So this is a bare minimum for this class.
